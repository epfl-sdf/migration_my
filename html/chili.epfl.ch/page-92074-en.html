                                Overview of available projects</h3>
                        
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13px; text-align: justify;">The CHILI lab is inventing learning technologies that exploit recent adavances in human-computer interaction (e.g. eye tracking, augmented reality, ...) and in human-robot interaction. We are</span><span style="font-size: 13px; text-align: justify;">&nbsp;working on several educational platforms described below. Each platforms offers possibilities for semester and master projects. While semester projects are often limited to development, master projects usually include an empir</span><span style="font-size: 13px; text-align: justify;">ical study with learners, supervised by our team. &nbsp;The platforms are:</span></p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>MOOC</strong> Platforms EdX and Coursera: the projects here are about processing the large data sets of interaction traces produced by these platforms in order to classify, understand or predict the behavior of learners, using machine learning or visualisation methods. Contact: patrick.jermann (at) epfl.ch</li>
	<li><strong>FROG i</strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-f3e56473-3a40-1b3a-a38c-5aa0be12c347" style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">s a platform to Fabricate and Run Orchestration Graphs, i.e. graphs that describe rich pedagogical scenarios. The projects concern the design of online real-time collaborative activities for learning and building a data analytics pipeline for monitoring and understanding students behavior. Contact: stian.haklev (at) epfl.ch.</span></span></li>
	<li><strong>REALTO</strong> is a social platform for vocational education. Apprentices collect pictures at the workplace and upload them on their class flow, where several picture annotation tools and augmented reality tools are available. Current projects concern these tools as well as a dashboard for teachers.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">Contact:&nbsp;catharine.oertel (at) epfl.ch</span></li>
	<li><strong>CELLULO</strong> is a small robot for education. It moves by itself and can be moved by pupils. The hardware is ready and projects concern the software environments as well as designing and experimenting with new learning activities. <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">Contact:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">wafa.johal (at) epfl.ch</span></li>

                                [Master] Soft Cellulo Component</h3>
                        
<p>The Cellulo project is concerned with tangible haptic-enabled swarm robots: 15+ small tabletop robots that work synchronously, each of which can move and be moved, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeSF6-75cY4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeSF6-75cY4</a>. So far, we have implemented an array of applications ranging from education (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv6nDMQCWCo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv6nDMQCWCo</a> and <a href="https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/224129?ln=en">https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/224129?ln=en</a>) to upper limb rehabilitation (see <a href="https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/254966?ln=en">https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/254966?ln=en</a>). While our robots can move and be moved, their haptic actuation is limited to simple kinesthetic sensations (such as low-resolution forces and motions) while their haptic sensing is non-existent.</p>
<p>The goal of this master&#39;s project is to integrate technologies from soft robotics in order to alleviate this problem, namely to enable detailed tactile actuation and sensing. More specifically, the student will collaborate with our lab and the Reconfigurable Robotics Lab in order to intetgrate soft robotics technologies developed there into Cellulo; see e.g Vacuum-Powered soft actuators (<a href="https://rrl.epfl.ch/page-148999.html">https://rrl.epfl.ch/page-148999.html</a>) and Soft Pneumatic actuators (<a href="https://rrl.epfl.ch/page-148990-en.html">https://rrl.epfl.ch/page-148990-en.html</a>). While we expect that this integration will certainly benefit the aforementioned applications, the student will aim to show that this is the case through a user study. In summary, the student will do the following:</p>
<p>- Become familiar with soft robotics technologies suitable for Cellulo<br />
	- Integrate a soft sensing/actuation component to Cellulo<br />
	- Design and run user study probing the effectiveness of the developed component
</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Experience in the following skills or interest in learning: Soft robotics, embedded systems development, rapid prototyping, QML/QtQuick development<br />

                                [Semester] Cellulo: Autonomous Pacman</h3>
                        
<p>In the<a href="http://chili.epfl.ch/cellulo"> Cellulo</a> project, we are designing tangible robots to be used in elementary school classrooms for learning activities and stroke rehabilitation. Our robots come out-of-the-box with connectivity to tablets and smartphones in order to use these readily available devices as orchestration/visualization tool, communication router and processing power source. Our application framework on these devices is Qt/QtQuick (C++ and QML) which allows us to write cross-platform modular code (PC and Android) where we can easily use existing peripherals and capabilities on the device.<br />
	<br />
	One game previously developed for rehabilitation is Pacman. In the Cellulo version of Pacman, the player was holding the Pacman robot in his hand and moving it through a maze to collect fruits. 2 Ghosts robots were chasing Pacman to steal his fruits. This setup has been used to collect a large amount of data from various participants. The aim of this semester project is to use the logs from these games in order to extract characteristic strategies and profiles of the players.<br />
	Secondly, we want to build an autonomous Pacman, in which the player is now controlling the Ghosts and has to chase an autonomous Pacman robot that collects the fruits following various strategies discovered via data-mining.
</p>
<p>The player model will finally be tested on totally new Pacman maps in order to test its robustness against the maze configuration.</p>
<p>To summarize the student will:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Extract game play strategies and user profiles from logs data.</li>
	<li>Implement an autonomous Pacman version of the game in which the user controls the ghosts.</li>
	<li>Evaluate this version of Cellulo-Pacman on maps with different maze.</li>
</ul>

                                [Semester] Cellulo: 3D Rehabilitation Game</h3>
                        
<p>In the<a href="http://chili.epfl.ch/cellulo">&nbsp;Cellulo</a>&nbsp;project, we are designing tangible robots to be used in upper limb functional rehabilitation among other purposes. Our robots operate on tabletop paper sheets and are used as game elements where they can be physical input devices and/or autonomous agents. Through this autonomous agent and input device capability, we can&nbsp;implicitly "force" the user to perform arm motions, resulting in&nbsp;exercise within activities that we design as games in order to ensure that the exercises are enjoyable to perform. One game we developed so far is tangible Pac-Man where the user has to move their Pac-Man robot to collect fruits while running away from Ghosts that chase them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The games we developed until now take place on the tabletop and we can create arm exercises that result from the 2D interaction. What we would like to explore next is to create multiple "floors" of&nbsp;workspaces, each with the encoded Cellulo paper that lets robots self-localize and move. The resulting game will thus take place in "3D" and will let the user also perform vertical arm exercises that we have been unable to generate so far, through interactions where the user will take robots from upper "floors" and place them on the lower "floors" and vice versa. The student will design and implement this game, as well as validate it through a small user study.</p>

                                [Semester] Cellulo: Learning Activity</h3>
                        
<p>The<a href="http://chili.epfl.ch/cellulo">&nbsp;Cellulo</a>&nbsp;project is concerned with&nbsp;tangible robots to be used in elementary school classrooms for learning activities, among other purposes. Our robots come out-of-the-box with connectivity to tablets and smartphones in order to use these readily available devices as orchestration/visualization tool, communication router and processing power source. Our application framework on these devices is Qt/QtQuick (C++ and QML) which allows us to write cross-platform modular code (PC and Android) where we can easily use existing peripherals and capabilities on the device.</p>
<p>One of the key ideas in the design of Cellulo&nbsp;is versatility, namely to serve a wide variety of purposes and to be used in the teaching of an array of curricular topics. We have so far designed activities around a number of topics in Meteorology, Geometry, Chemistry and Mathematics. We further have a catalog of design ideas for topics that we did not touch yet, and the purpose of this project is to design and implement one such activity to be used in the teaching of a new topic.&nbsp;The student will decide on a topic, design and implement the activity and its pedagogical scenario&nbsp;with our robots. Furthermore, a small user study will be conducted to verify the effect of the developed activity.​​​​​​​</p>

                                [Semester] Cellulo: Tangible Game with Dynamic Workspace </h3>
                        
<p>In the<a href="http://chili.epfl.ch/cellulo">&nbsp;Cellulo</a>&nbsp;project, we are designing tangible robots to be used in games, among other purposes. Our robots operate on tabletop paper sheets and are used as game elements where they can be physical input devices and/or autonomous agents. Our hypothesis is that we can build tabletop games with these robots that can move and be moved, possibly at the same time. We can further design games with many robots that can exhibit swarm behaviors, and one of our current goals is to explore game design options that create engaging interactions between multiple players and these robots.</p>
<p>Our robots work on printed paper sheets that can be produced with up to ~1m width and with unlimited length, and so far we have used these large shared&nbsp;workspaces&nbsp;within our activities to promote scalable&nbsp;multi-user interaction. We have recently developed smaller&nbsp;workspaces&nbsp;that can be tiled dynamically during runtime, allowing the growing, shrinking and modification of the workspace and its shape by the players. The goal of this project is to design a tangible game that uses this element at its core, together with the Cellulo&nbsp;robots. The resulting game will require the players to build the shape and the functionality of the workspace itself as the game progresses, on which their robots will move and be moved. A small user study will be conducted at the end to validate the player interaction with the developed game.</p>

                                [Semester] CoPainter: Drawing Activity with Nao Robot</h3>
                        
<p>The <a href="http://chili.epfl.ch/cowriter">CoWriter</a>&nbsp;project aims to develop an Child-Robot-Interaction based on the learning by teaching paradigm: we ask a child to teach handwriting to a Nao robot. The educational/therapeutic success of such an interaction is mainly based on the engagement of children in the interaction. For the moment we have 3 activities but our idea is to implement broad types of activities in order to switch activities according to the child&rsquo;s learning level and&nbsp; attentional state.<br />
	<br />
	The aim of this semester project is to develop a drawing activity involving the Nao robot, that will be tested later on with children. During this project you will be in charge of the software development of the activity controlling the Nao robot. The student will also develop the tablet application allowing drawing.<br />
	Using the same principle as the <a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/#">QuickDraw</a> online game, the robot and the child will play a pictionary-like game. The goal will be to collect drawing data and adpat the difficulty of the game with the ability of the child.
</p>
<p>The activity should be ROS based and be integrated to the whole CoWriter project. The student will:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Explore the QuickDraw dataset to generate different levels of drawing difficulty.</li>
	<li>Develop an interactive scenario with Nao using an android tablet.</li>
	<li>Integrate the activity within the CoWriter project.<br />

<h3>[Semester] Bibliometric analysis of scholarly community (SNA, topic extraction)</h3>
<p>This student will get access to 15 years of digitized conference proceedings from a Learning Science conference &ndash; around 2-300 papers per year for 15 years (PDFs, with metadata, easy to extract text). The project is to do a bibliometric&nbsp;study on citations (metadata, co-authorships over time), and text contents (using topic modeling, word embeddings, conceptnet etc). We could look at co-authorship (who is co-authoring with whom) over time, topic modeling over time (when did MOOCs first start getting mentioned? How much is about natural sciences vs literature?)&hellip; It might also be interesting to look at open repositories of publications from some other conferences to see how similar they are - how many people are participating in both communities, do ideas begin in one community and then &ldquo;jump over&rdquo; to another community (time-lag), etc. Aim is journal paper, if student is interested, he/she can be involved and become co-author (will require some additional time beyond the end of the project), but this is optional.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-requisites:&nbsp;</strong>Should have some experience with machine learning, NLP/text analytics, social network analysis etc. Python or R.&nbsp;<br />

                                [Master/semester] FROG</h3>
                        
<p>FROG is an open-source web-platform to author (design) and run rich collaborative learning activities. It introduces a concept of pluggable activity types (like video player, quiz, brainstorming or programming exercises), which can be configured by the designer, and connected in a learning graph, with data from one activity being transformed and reused in another (ideas from a brainstorm flowing into a concept map tool), and with pluggable &ldquo;operators&rdquo;, which can transform data, intelligently group students, etc. through the use of algorithms and machine learning.</p>
<p>While the teacher runs the class, intelligent visualizations show not only simple facts like how many people have watched a given video, but can provide predictions based upon analysis of student actions with the activities. This platform might be used in small classrooms, large lectures (we are currently doing experiments with 350 students in a lecture at UNIL), or MOOCs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FROG team offers a number of interesting and challenging projects, in terms of web development, infrastructure and testing, developing and testing algorithms, running experiments, and user interface design/HCI.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />

<p><em>If you find the project interesting, and have a specific idea that is not listed below, we are flexible and would still like to hear from you! For any of these positions, please contact stian.haklev@epfl.ch unless otherwise noted.</em></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><strong>Customizable Chatbots</strong></h4>
<p dir="ltr">Students do not always need the same help at the same time. Therefore it can be important to customize the support given to students. In this project, we aim to develop a chatbot which can easily be adapted to different chat content. This project will be between the DUAL-T project and the FROG project. The goals of the project is to integrate the chat bot into an already existing chat interface. It should be able to parse and generate meaningful content within a closed domain. If time, the way that the bot reacts will be customizable.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Prerequisites: Strong knowledge of Javascript and interest in automated software testing. </strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Innovative activity supporting rich collaboration in React</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Activity types (tools) in FROG are the corner-stones of collaborative learning. Past student projects have resulted in a synchronous PDF viewer/annotation tool, flexible video chat with WebRTC, an online code editor which can run Python in the browser, and collaboratively editable forms. This is an opportunity to work with cutting edge web technologies (React, Flow typing, Meteor, etc) on an open source project that will be used by many. There are several ideas for new activities, including a collaborative concept map, rich text editing with some wiki&nbsp;integration, or integration with an external knowledge base such as Slack or Discourse, but we are also open for other ideas.</p>

</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Analyzing collaborative synchronous writing traces to automatically determine role taking and collaboration quality</h4>
<p>Students who collaborate using Etherpad or Google Docs generate large amounts of very granular data (every single key press, time sequences, etc), which could potentially tell us about which roles the students are taking (outlining, adding information, brainstorming, re-organizing, fixing spelling mistakes), and how well the students are collaborating, all measures which can be calculated over time to see transitions between states/roles. We could also add semantic data on the text contents to this dynamic analysis to see how for example two students who read different articles gradually "converge" in their editing (or not). We have two available positions: one will focus on pure behavioural (editing) data, and try to do unsupervised and supervised modeling to detect and visualize role taking, editing process, etc. The second will attempt to enhanced the analysis with semantic information (using things like word2vec). We have data from collaborative writing experiments which the students will work on. <a href="https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/255287?ln=en">Previous paper</a>.<br />

</p>
<h4>Prototyping redesigns of a complex user interface / usability testing / HCI</h4>
<p>FROG&rsquo;s editor aims to enable a teacher or researcher to configure a complex learning flow, including multiple activities, on multiple social planes, with social groupings and data flow. The orchestration view acts as the &ldquo;driver&rsquo;s seat&rdquo; during the class, offering controls and data visualizations to enable the teacher to be aware of what is going on with multiple students working alone and in groups with multiple activities. These are all complex information representation and user interface challenges, and there is much room for improvement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are currently engaged in a process of redesigning our interface, and we are looking for a student project related to user interface design and usability testing. Depending on student interest, the focus could be more focused on developing alternative design prototypes, or on carrying out usability tests with different users, and writing a usability report about our current interface.&nbsp;<br />
	<em><strong>Prerequisites: Students should have some experience with the theory or practice of user interface design, designing prototypes and/or conducting usability studies. Please provide examples of prototyping projects that you have completed and the tools that were used.</strong></em><br />
	<em><strong>Contact: jennifer.olsen@epfl.ch</strong></em>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Developing/prototyping the ideal video chat interface for distance learning</h4>
<p>Skype or Google Hangout are commonly used also in education, to support small groups of students discussing or working on a problem, however they were never designed for education. In FROG, we currently have flexible video chat built into the platform. This means that we can randomly assign students to various groups, switch them from one group to another, and have them work with different synchronous collaboration tools (editor, code editor, image annotation, concept mapping etc) while talking.</p>
<p>Since we have full control over the video chat, we can experiment with different kinds of visual interfaces and interactions to see what works best for different kinds of collaborative learning - is there a difference between small or large video boxes, making the current speaker larger, or maybe even hiding video altogether while the students are working on a collaborative problem. Perhaps we can support explicit turn-taking, show visualizations of which student is speaking more to support group awareness etc. We&#39;re looking for a student interested in prototyping different interfaces, and run small experiments to see which work better (in what situations). This could lead to an academic paper, if the student is interested.<br />
	<em><strong>Prerequisites: Students should have some experience with the theory or practice of user interface design, designing prototypes and/or conducting usability studies. Please provide examples of prototyping projects that you have completed and the tools that were used.</strong></em><br />

<h4>Automated testing of complex multi-user web application</h4>
<p>FROG consists of an editor, an engine, and a large number of pluggable activity types and operator types (data transformation). The activity types all support live collaboration with data sync, enabling two or more students to work together. When a graph is running, there is a flow of data between activities, students are grouped based on the output of algorithms etc. While we use unit-tests to ensure the functionality of small modules, we are currently investigating integration tests that will enable us to automatically test a large number of different configurations and flows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students interested in advanced automatic testing could for example help us develop a domain-specific language to describe a graph and the inputs that students would provide in each activity, letting a test-runner &ldquo;execute&rdquo; an entire graph, with virtual students and teachers. Another approach could be to use property-based testing and our internal type system to automatically generate theoretically valid graphs and data inputs, and test that no &ldquo;allowed input&rdquo; breaks the system. A final issue is how to do integration testing of a multi-user live-synced app - ensuring that if one user types something, it appears on the other users&rsquo; screen, etc.&nbsp;<br />
	<em><strong>Prerequisites: Strong knowledge of Javascript and interest in automated software testing, reliability Q&amp;A etc.&nbsp;<br />

<p><strong>Large scale instructional design analysis, comparing thousands of graphs</strong></p>
<p>LAMS is a platform similar to FROG, which lets users visually design a learning scenario, with individual and collaborative activities connected with data flow and teacher actions. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/v8PZ1Ye">Example of a script</a>. The difference is that LAMS has been in use for over 15 years. We will get access to 18,000 different LAMS scripts designed by teachers, and actually used by students, and we are interested in doing data analysis on this unique data set. The graphs are stored as structured XML, and we should be able to parse them, and extract for example common structures - can we detect common instructional patterns in scripts? Can we visualize what activity sequences often follow each other, or common transitions (which activities are involved when switching from an individual to a group plane?). This project requires some creativity - beginning with what intermediary format to store the graphs in - is it better to use a graph database, or perhaps treat them as a corpus, to be able to analyze n-grams, and even word2vec (with activities as tokens). Possibility to publish paper if student is interested.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Prerequisites: Experience in data analytics or machine learning, using Python or R. Experience with or interest in graph databases, data wrangling, NLP, word2vec, topic modeling, etc.<br />

<h4>Devops: How to automatically deploy, scale on demand, and have error recovery for a somehow complex app?</h4>
<div>Running FROG in development mode is designed to be as easy as possible, but in production when we need to scale to multiple servers, we have several different services that need to be coordinated - the Meteor processes that run FROG, other node servers, Redis, MongoDB, some Python servers, nginx for SSL&nbsp;reverse proxying and load balancing etc. We often spin up 10 VMs, but if we want to do large scale deployments in MOOCs&nbsp;we would probably need many more. Currently this is all done semi-manually. We&#39;re looking for someone to help us develop a proper devops approach, possibly using the EPFL&nbsp;Kubernetes cluster, letting us deploy a whole infrastructure in one keystroke, automatically restarting failed servers, scaling up based on demand, etc.</div>
<div><strong>Pre-requisites:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Some background and interest in devops, Docker, Kubernetes&nbsp;and other cloud infrastructure.</strong></div>

                                [Master] REALTO: Online learning platform for integrated vocational education</h3>
                        
<p dir="ltr">REALTO&nbsp;is a social platform for vocational education. Apprentices collect pictures (and videos) at the workplace and upload them on their class flow. Supervisors and teachers have the possibility to provide feedback on the students private flow and peers have the possibility to comment on other students pictures and videos. Over 2000 apprentices from a wide variety of disciplines such as florists, carpenters, fashion designers are currently registered on REALTO.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Following are the list of available projects and their descriptions. In case of interest, please send an email to the contact person. In your email, please include your CV and a short description of your specific interests.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><b id="docs-internal-guid-452afa8a-cd84-e992-0240-e0b40c3be05a">User interaction design with interactive graph</b></u></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: On REALTO, apprentices upload pictures taken from their workplace experiences and share them in the digital space. Apprentices can not only share the pictures, but also create variations of the pictures. With a set of shared/generated pictures, it is an interesting question how to present the related data to the users based on their input. The goal of this semester project is to design a user interaction that allows users to navigate and explore the data space. Applications would be a design exploration tool or a recommender system. One idea is to use interactive graphs that expand as users explore the space.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: experience in following topics or interest in learning: user interaction design, recommender systems, data visualization, JavaScript, React, D3.js.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Designing a Virtual Communication Trainer</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Sales clerks are every day confronted with very different and often challenging situations. A angry customer, an undecided customer, a customer which tells his or her whole life in an unsolicited manner. All of these situations are potentially hard to handle, especially for someone who is just starting into a new career. Currently, apprentices already have the possibility to upload videos out of such everyday work experience to REALTO. The goal of this semester project is to &nbsp;organize these interactions &nbsp;by topics (e.g. angry customer) and then use this data to implement a virtual agent who is able to take on the role of an e.g. angry customer. The purpose of the implementation is to provide the apprentice with a communication trainer.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Design a dialogue flow</li>
	<li>Implement a limited domain dialogue system with a virtual agent</li>
	<li>Integrate the system within the REALTO platform</li>
</ul>

<p><u><strong>Detection of the technological vanguard on Stack Overflow</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>:&nbsp;Stack Overflow is a widely-known Q&amp;A platform for developers, and many developers are themselves contributors, both in asking questions and answering them. These developers may have varying levels of expertise, and also varying levels of knowledge diversity. We hypothesise that many of said developers are constantly in touch with the latest news and developments in the IT industry, and that their behaviour on Stack Overflow would reflect emerging innovations. One of the main challenges of the project is to come up with an evaluation scheme or some kind of ground truth. Since this project is part of a greater project on understanding trends on Stack Overflow, you will be working in a team and there will be a lot of collaboration involved.</p>
<p><strong>Aims</strong>: The aim of this project is the detection of this &lsquo;vanguard&rsquo; on Stack Overflow, to understand the entry points of innovations into Stack Overflow, and to describe the features of this vanguard.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: The project will utilise machine learning and network analysis techniques and therefore familiarity with at least one is necessary. Experience with Python is also necessary, and familiarity with some of the implementations of said techniques in Python is a big plus. Last but not least, we&rsquo;re looking for highly motivated people - if you are one, sign right up!</p>

<p><u><strong>Educational Game Design for Inter-Class Collaboration</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: One fact of vocational education is that apprentices are often working in small groups and do not have the possibility to exchange ideas across classrooms. Many of the apprentices in fact feel quite alone in their apprenticeship. Yet, being successful in an apprenticeship and also in later on in building a successful career is facilitated by having a large network of peers.<br />
	The goal of this project is to developing a game which makes it possible for students to collaborate on a topic which is relevant to their studies across classrooms.
</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Design a or collaborative game</li>
	<li>Implement it on REALTO</li>
</ul>

<p><u><strong>Object detection using deep learning</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: On REALTO, apprentices upload pictures taken from their workplaces and share them in the digital space. In order to make a better use of the uploaded data, it is important to have some semantic understanding about the image. Recent advancement of deep learning algorithms has improved the performance on the problem of image-based object detection. The goal of this project is to implement, train, and test a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to recognize objects from images. We are currently working with a dataset of flower bouquets (for florists). We can also consider other applications in the context of vocational education.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: experience in following topics or interest in learning: machine learning, deep learning, image processing, python</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>Learning and teaching of productive problem-solving</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Productive problem-solving consists in restructuring the perception of a problem such that a novel solution for this problem can be found. Computational technologies can help to achieve this kind of human problem-solving by helping to augment for example digital pictures of a problem situation or a series of digital pictures on a procedure to solve a problem with additional information. This kind of productive problem-solving is increasingly required for work. Vocational teachers prepare apprentices for work by using didactical procedures that trigger their learning. These procedures also involve approaches such as the teaching of &laquo;problem-based&raquo; learning, which serve to train the skill to solve problems. The goal of this semester project is to develop for and implement into REALTO a problem-based learning and teaching scenario that serves apprentices to train the skill to solve problems productively.</p>
