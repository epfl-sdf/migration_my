Concrete is the world&#39;s most widely used construction material and the structures made of it are subjected to dynamic loads during their long service lives. However, the physical mechanisms leading to its dynamic failure are not well understood. We consider concrete from a mesoscopic point of view, where coarse aggregates, mortar paste and the interfacial transition zone can explicitly be represented. The explicit modeling of the first-level heterogeneities makes mesoscale the most convenient scale to study fracture.    The well-established finite-element method is used for the numerical analysis. Fracture is modeled by cohesive elements, which are inserted dynamically when the stress at an inter-element boundary exceeds a local threshold. A robust and scalable parallel implementation of the method is utilized to analyze large scale three-dimensional models.    We begin analyzing the influence of material heterogeneities by modeling limited aggregate patterns. This approach allows us to focus on a single propagating crack and to isolate the changes in the elastic field and stress wave interactions. Fracture behavior is analyzed by using the Brazilian splitting test with a physically identified heterogeneity and the pre-strained plate configuration. The crack tip is shown to be repelled by the stiffer inclusions while it is attracted to the denser ones. Furthermore, by introducing denser media around the crack propagation direction, we are able to decrease its steady-state velocity. The crack is slowed down by trapping the mechanical waves in the denser region thus limiting the energy flowing to its tip. We argue that the criterion for crack branching should be based on the available energy instead of the crack tip velocity as suggested by early works.    A three-dimensional mesoscale model is then developed to obtain the total mechanical response of concrete. The specimens are subjected to uniaxial tensile loading in a dynamic setting and the so-called ``rate effect&#39;&#39; is investigated. Micro-inertial forces are shown to be insufficient in two and three dimensions making a rate-dependent material model necessary to account the strengthening due to the moisture content in pores. Finally, a percolation analysis is carried out to investigate cluster properties such as number and size distribution. With a parametric study, we consider physically admissible ranges of coarse aggregate contents, random material parameters, applied strain rates and simulation box sizes. The size distribution of the clusters is defined by a power-law fit regardless of the parameters mentioned above, indicating a universal phenomenon is at play. Damage evolution is further studied by comparing the percolated damage clusters with the final cracking map.</p></div><ul class="record-metadata"><p></p><p class="infoscience_links"><a class="infoscience_link_detailed" href="https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/230244?ln=en" target="_blank">Detailed record</a>

This chemical reaction occurs between  the amorphous silica contained inside the aggregates, and the alkalis  of the cement pore solution. During the reaction hydrophilic silica  gel forms, which starts swelling as it absorbs water. This induces  internal stresses in the concrete, which in turn cause macroscopic  expansion and cracking. Due to its deleterious effects on the  mechanical properties of concrete, the ASR is more commonly known as  concrete cancer.      The speed of the chemical degradation process of ASR is slow  and, thus, the consequences in an affected structure often become  visible only after many service years. The need to assess the  influence of the ASR-induced degradation process on the safety and  serviceability of affected concrete structures has led to intensive  research activities over the last decades. Both experimental and  modeling studies, have provided fundamental insights on the physics of  ASR at the meso-scale of concrete. At this scale concrete is typically  described as a heterogeneous material, consisting of aggregates  embedded in the cement paste. It is, however, not yet well understood  how the mesoscopic damage evolution influences the overall material  behavior of concrete at the macro-scale, i.e. the structural scale.      In the present thesis a numerical framework for ASR is developed,  which aims at providing answers regarding the link between the  mesoscopic and macroscopic consequences of ASR. For this purpose an  ASR meso-scale model is implemented in an open-source finite element  library. This numerical development makes the execution of  high-performance computing simulations possible, in which the complex  ASR-induced crack networks can be captured with an unprecedented level  of detail. Moreover, large sets of parametric studies are carried out  in order to identify the main influencing numerical and physical  parameters of the model.    A multi-scale finite element approach is,  subsequently, applied in order to up-scale the mesoscopic material  response of ASR-affected concrete. This strategy allows to conduct  simulations of the mechanical consequences of ASR in large concrete  structures, in which the material behavior of concrete is directly  governed by the physics of ASR occurring at the meso-scale.</p></div><ul class="record-metadata"><p></p><p class="infoscience_links"><a class="infoscience_link_detailed" href="https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/227479?ln=en" target="_blank">Detailed record</a>

To understand the size dependence of materials properties, the interaction and evolution of defects are essential. As such, the role played by dislocations is crucial for modeling metallic materials. In essence, a dislocation is a default in the crystalline periodicity that creates long-range stress fields, which makes the modeling of dislocation dynamics a challenging problem.    This thesis concentrates on the development of a novel multiscale method, which couples concurrently dislocation dynamics at nano- and micro-scales. A version of this method, the \textit{Coupled Atomistic and Discrete Dislocations} (CADD), exists for two-dimensional problems. Its three-dimensional extension (CADD3d) is developed theoretically, and then implemented including the necessary parallel computing aspects. The proposed model requires two main building blocks, which are linked to general dislocation properties.    The first component is the correction field of the linear elasticity solution for dislocation cores. The core structures are pre-computed by modeling straight dislocations with arbitrary mixed angles using atomistic simulations. The obtained results are validated by extending the variational Peierls-Nabarro method. Finally, the templates including the core correction field are generated from the calculated core structures.    The second building block is the mobility law of dislocations. The dislocation mobilities for several orientations and temperatures are studied with atomistic simulations, and validated by comparisons to theoretical models. The mobility law is characterized by two damping mechanisms, the phonon viscosity and the phonon radiation effects.    CADD3d is then examined by studying several benchmark problems, which prove that the CADD3d method is a valid approach to couple atomistic and discrete dislocation dynamics including when multiple curved dislocations dynamics have to be considered.    Furthermore, to highlight the applicability of CADD3d for material plasticity problems, a Frank-Read source in an aluminum alloy is studied.  The application result provides interesting insights on the mechanisms of solid-solution strengthening and grain-hardening effects at the nano and micro scales.</p></div><ul class="record-metadata"><p></p><p class="infoscience_links"><a class="infoscience_link_detailed" href="https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/225968?ln=en" target="_blank">Detailed record</a>

This phenomenon occurs in a material when a blast or impact loading nucleates multiple cracks, whose propagation and coalescence break the specimen into fragments. Although since the beginning of the last century this topic has been well studied in many fields ranging from engineering to astrophysics, its complexity is still keeping researchers far from a complete understanding of it. Analytical approaches are challenging and sometimes unfeasible, while experiments are limited in scale and are hard to realize due to the extreme rapidity of the phenomenon. In this context, numerical methods constitute a useful tool to provide insights and complement the traditional models. Among the existing techniques, the finite-element method with dynamic insertion of cohesive elements represents an excellent compromise between performance and realistic modeling. The first topic of the thesis is the prediction of residual velocities of fragments. Even in tensile fragmentation, their relative velocity difference leads to impacts, redistributing the kinetic energy in the system. This event is studied in an elementary setup: a quasi-1D ceramic bar is subjected to a constant blast tensile loading until failure. With this simple model, it is possible to identify the link between the elastic waves and the different relative velocities of the fragments, that cause impacts. This aspect highlights the importance of including a realistic reproduction of contact in the numerical models. Another topic is the connection between the shape of a 3D ceramic specimen and its fragmentation patterns, in particular concerning the mass and shape distributions of the fragments. For this purpose extremely large meshes are needed and an optimization of the code is necessary. The best strategy is to extend the algorithms to work in parallel in order to take advantage of the most modern clusters available at EPFL. This accomplishment, together with the analysis and solution of a numerical instability that can affect the method, results in the realization of a powerful numerical tool for large 2D and 3D dynamic fragmentation problems. The last subject treated in this thesis is the influence of eigenstresses on the dynamic fragmentation of glass. The plates made of this material can be thermally treated in order to obtain compression residual stresses along the surfaces, that are balanced by tensile residual stresses in the interior. Therefore the flexural strength is increased but, whenever a crack reaches the tensile region, it becomes unstable and the plate quickly breaks into fragments. In the past, researchers tried to predict both analytically and experimentally the number of fragments as function of the residual stress magnitude and the plate thickness. However the available models are partially inaccurate and in contradiction with each other. Thanks to the parallel implementation of the dynamic insertion of cohesive elements, now also numerical simulations are a valid tool to explore the underlying physics. Their usage permits to easily monitor the evolution of potential, dissipated and kinetic energies over time, highlighting the flaws of the existing analytical approaches as well as providing more information than experiments. A new mathematical expression is proposed to accurately predict the number of fragments in function of the plate thickness for high values of residual stress.</p></div><ul class="record-metadata"><p></p><p class="infoscience_links"><a class="infoscience_link_detailed" href="https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/213657?ln=en" target="_blank">Detailed record</a>

The investigation of the underlying mechanisms which lead to these properties is experimentally challenging and the interpretations need to be numerically and analytically complemented. This research attempts to explore the influential parameters on dynamic crack propagation in silicon nitride microstructures through 2D tensile loading finite-element simulations. The dynamic macroscopic mechanical properties of toughness and strength, are evaluated as function of strain rate, microstructural and mechanical parameters. Voronoi tessellations are considered to model regular grains and these grains are merged to represent elongated ones. The model incorporates dynamic insertion of cohesive elements representing intergranular and transgranular cracking. The fracture modeling is enriched by using a parallel finite-element code for cohesive element insertion, which brings a significant increase in studied degrees of freedom. Diffuse crack networks are represented by a graph and its geometrical and mechanical properties are extracted with the help of graph properties. Simulation results reveal that material inertia causes strain rate strengthening. Moreover, elongated grains represent reinforcements in the specimen and contribute to the rate-hardening. Exploiting a parallel finite-element code for cohesive element insertion enables statistically-significant simulations of a main crack propagation and calibration of transgranular fracture properties with experimental data. The main crack deflection/penetration events at grain boundaries are compared with analytical static (Hutchinson and Suo, 1992) and dynamic (Xu et al., 2003) theories. It is seen that by neglecting the cases in which the crack tip jumps due to coalescence into a micro-daughter crack, the dynamic analytical criterion provides an accurate prediction for the crack path. Moreover, the main crack length and roughness are analyzed for different grain sizes and fracture properties of grains. It is observed that fine and coarse grains introduce local roughness and large deviations in the crack path respectively. A mutual competition of the crack length and transgranular fracture percentage specifies the material&#39;s toughness.</p></div><ul class="record-metadata"><p></p><p class="infoscience_links"><a class="infoscience_link_detailed" href="https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/207730?ln=en" target="_blank">Detailed record</a>

Friction is a truly multi-scale phenomenon with a large variety of processes acting at various length and time scales. In recent years, much attention was paid to the micro- and nano-scale properties of frictional interfaces in order to uncover the origins of friction. The structural aspects of friction at the meso- to macro-scales have, however, often been neglected. This thesis aims at demonstrating that these aspects are key to the frictional response of macroscopic systems and pursues therefore the objective of improving today&#39;s knowledge of the rupture-like propagation of slip fronts at frictional interfaces. The mechanics of frictional interfaces is studied with state-of-the-art dynamic finite-element simulations of systems mimicking experimental set-ups. Two and three-dimensional simulations are conducted according to the nature of the studied phenomena. In addition, theoretical models based on fracture mechanics theory are developed and applied to confirm the numerical observations. These models provide insights on the underlying mechanisms of the slip front propagation and reveal the influence of various system, material, and interface parameters. The results presented in this thesis show that the applied numerical models reproduce quantitatively well experimental observations as reported in literature. The studied aspects of frictional slip include, among others, the propagation speed, the arrest position, and the effect of interface heterogeneity. Beyond confirming experimental observations, the simulations and theoretical models further reveal new features of the propagation and arrest of slip fronts. They show, for instance, that the speed of slip fronts depends on the propagation direction and that the arrest position of slip precursors is predictable with linear elastic fracture mechanics theory. Furthermore, simulations of slip fronts at heterogeneous interfaces uncover an interaction between the length scales of the slip front and the heterogeneous pattern.</p></div><ul class="record-metadata"><p></p><p class="infoscience_links"><a class="infoscience_link_detailed" href="https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/203723?ln=en" target="_blank">Detailed record</a>

Atomistic effects that violate continuum theory dominate the deformations of contacting asperities, while the interactions between distant asperities occur through long-range elasticity. This thesis concentrates on the numerical modelling of nanoscale frictional contact between crystalline metals by using both single-scale atomistic methods and improving concurrent multiscale methods. A novel approach to quantify frictional work and the energy associated with plastic activity in \md simulations is presented. In combination with a statistical criterion to determine the significance of simulation box size, microstructure and sliding rate effects on the frictional quantities such as the friction coefficient and stored plastic energies, the method is used in a large parametric molecular dynamics study of single-asperity nanoscratch on monocrystalline and polycrystalline aluminium substrates. Some fundamental differences in the friction mechanisms between monocrystalline and polycrystalline substrates are presented. The study shows the limitations of single-scale modelling and highlights the importance of developing appropriate multiscale methods for nanoscale plasticity. One such method is the Coupled Atomistics and Discrete Dislocations (CADD), which previously only existed for two-dimensional problems. A three-dimensional version of the CADD method is presented theoretically as well as a detailed practical road map for its efficient implementation. The foundations of three-dimensional CADD are presented using practical test cases. CADD avoids ghost forces at the coupling interfaces through displacement-coupling. I reveal that such displacement-coupling methods generally exhibit an inherent dynamic instability which makes them particularly ill suited for finite temperature calculations, despite their wide use. The instability is analysed in detail. Multiple remedies to manage it are discussed and a fundamental solution to the underlying problem is presented in the form of a new coupling method.</p></div><ul class="record-metadata"><p></p><p class="infoscience_links"><a class="infoscience_link_detailed" href="https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/202204?ln=en" target="_blank">Detailed record</a>

It is       primarily characterized by the disruption of the       cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow within the ventricular system.       Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a form of       hydrocephalus for which the enlargement of ventricles occurs       although the intracranial pressure (ICP) remains close to       normal. The pressure gradient between the source of CSF       production in the ventricles and the absorption sites is       reported to be very low (∼1 mm Hg), i.e. within the       experimental errors. The mechanism of NPH evolution is still       obscure and its distinction from the other causes of dementia       such as Alzheimer and neurodegenerative diseases is       difficult. The present work contributes to a better       understanding of the NPH mechanism in terms of CSF       disturbances and/or parenchyma defects. To this end, imaging       techniques such as Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),       Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and Magnetic resonance       elastography (MRE) are used together with a finite element       (FE) model. As a final step, NPH onset and evolution are       clarified via a theoretical model for healthy and NPH brains       assuming a spherical geometry. The proposed mechanism is       further analyzed in a realistic 3D model of the brain       parenchyma. Geometries of ventricular system and skull are obtained       from MRI images of a human brain. DTI data are used to       establish the fiber tracts direction as well as the local       frame of anisotropic elasticity and permeability. The brain       parenchyma is considered as a poro-elastic material where the       tissue displacement and CSF flow are modeled using the Biot&#39;s       theory. A link between the CSF diffusion and CSF permeability       in brain parenchyma is established and the importance of       space dependent CSF content and transverse isotropic (TI)       permeability is highlighted in case of low pressure gradient       hydrocephalus. Calculations are carried out to simulate the       ventricular dilation using FE softwares such as       MATLAB® and COMSOL®. The       numerical results show that consideration of space dependent       CSF content and TI permeability leads to a much more       realistic model for NPH in terms of CSF velocity and CSF       content. Anisotropic MRE experiment is conducted over selected       slices of a healthy human brain. The experimental results are       statistically refined and further used to assess the healthy       brain stiffness as well as the degree of anisotropy in       elasticity. Moreover, the constitutive behavior of the white       matter is modeled as a composite material containing fiber       tracts surrounded by a matrix; with the assumption of a low       fiber-matrix bonding and fiber tract undulation. A non-linear       elastic model is proposed in order to take into account the       load transfer from white matter matrix to fiber tracts when       these are fully stretched. The unknown value of the elastic       coefficients in a sick brain is determined by using inverse       modeling, i.e. by adjusting these coefficients so that the       right ventricle dilation is obtained. It is demonstrated that       NPH development can be associated with a degradation of the       brain parenchyma elastic stiffness in NPH patients. It is       shown that during NPH development, a load transfer from the       white matter matrix (cell bodies and interstitial fluid) to       fiber tracts takes place, initiating elastic anisotropy in       white matter tissues at rather large strains. An analytical approach is developed to seek the underlying       NPH mechanism in a simplified model of brain. Without further       refinement in the constitutive equation or adding complexity       to the material behavior, the Biot&#39;s formulation is regarded       as the basis. However, an absorption term is added to the       Biot&#39;s model to consider the possible transparenchymal CSF       resorption. The ventricle stability concept is introduced and       is further utilized to investigate the equilibrium positions.       The influence of different biomechanical parameters on the       stable ventricle geometry is assessed and the healthy and NPH       equilibrium positions are found to be dependent in particular       on the CSF seepage through the ventricle wall and the       absorption and permeability coefficients of the brain       parenchyma. Although very simple, the proposed analytical       model is able to predict the onset and development of NPH       conditions as a deviation from healthy conditions. Incorporating the stability concept in a more realistic       geometry of brain (3D), the respective equilibrium positions       are recaptured using the parameter values provided by the       analytical spherical model. The disruption of ventricle       surface during the NPH development increases CSF seepage and       consequently the medium permeability. A dilation dependent       permeability is moreover incorporated in a 3D model of the       brain. The results emphasize the importance of strain       dependent permeability which favors the ventricle       equilibrations in more realistic geometries of brain. Future       works might consider the time dependent deformation (creep       effects and stress induced remodeling) of ventricles and the       incorporation of anisotropic permeability and elasticity in       the 3D model. The geometry should be extended to the full       ventricular system including the subarachnoid spaces       (SAS).</p></div><ul class="record-metadata"><p></p><p class="infoscience_links"><a class="infoscience_link_detailed" href="https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/168645?ln=en" target="_blank">Detailed record</a>

The use of computational       facilities, rather than experimental or fundamental sciences,       ensures the accurate tracking of rapidly evolving fields       (such as stress field, energies and damage). The numerical       framework is based on Galerkin approximations coupled to the       Cohesive Zone model, which addresses the failure response.       Depending on the number of degrees of freedom, serial or       parallel simulations are performed. The finite element method       with dynamic insertion of cohesive elements constitutes the       basis of the serial calculations. However, it is replaced by       the scalable discontinuous Galerkin formulation for parallel       computing. Both frameworks recover accurately the physical       mechanisms behind dynamic fragmentation. The thesis is organized to handle gradually increasing       complexity. First, the fragmentation of a quasi       one-dimensional expanding ring, constituted of a       heterogeneous material, is simulated. It involves two major       mechanisms: crack initiation and crack interaction. Fragment       sizes are highly dependent upon strain rate, material       properties, and microstructural heterogeneity. Scaling laws       of the average fragment size, as well as of the distribution       of fragment masses, are proposed and lead to predictable       laws. Then, crack propagation mechanisms are investigated       through parallel simulations of the quasi three-dimensional       breakage of a thin plate. By analyzing the energetic       response, two regimes are defined: the strength controlled       and the toughness controlled. At low strain rates, defects       play a key role and govern energy levels. They correspond to       the strength controlled regime and induce disordered       responses. At high strain rates, fragmentation is more       organized, fragment masses follow Weibull distributions, and       crack interactions become secondary. This is the toughness       controlled regime, governed by energetic arguments. The       transition between the two regimes is derived as a function       of material parameters. Finally, the transition between two- and three-dimensional       fragmentation is analyzed. Massively parallel simulations of       the fragmentation of a hollow sphere with variable thickness       are conducted. The effect of dimensionality upon fragment       shape and fragment mass distributions is analyzed. Interestingly, although these three tests involve distinct       mechanisms due to the specimen geometry, they share common       behaviors. Quasi-static loadings lead to highly dynamic       fragmentation processes, involving extensive stress wave       interactions. Defect distributions play a key role. By       contrast, dynamic loadings are associated to smoother and       more deterministic responses. They are primarily controlled       by energy arguments. As suggested by Grady&#39;s energy balance       theory, this results in a predictable dependence of the       average fragment size and strain rate, characterized by a       power law of exponent -2/3. However, we recover more       fragments than Grady because of our ability to reproduce       explicitly and accurately time-dependent mechanisms (dynamics       of stress waves and energy transfers). Therefore, the interpretation of these numerical results       sheds light on the complexity of the physics underlying       fragmentation. The dynamics of stress waves, energetic       arguments, the loading conditions, the dimensionality of the       geometry, and the material itself (bulk and defects) must be       all evoked to draw a global picture of the phenomenon.       Reproducing such processes requires a high level of accuracy       that novel parallel numerical frameworks are able to       provide.</p></div><ul class="record-metadata"><p></p><p class="infoscience_links"><a class="infoscience_link_detailed" href="https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/153012?ln=en" target="_blank">Detailed record</a>

Local authorities have been trying to mitigate the risk by zoning regulations as well as by building protection structures for many years. These measures have, however, in most cases been designed based on knowledge from past events. Numerical models have started emerging about 30 years ago. While a variety of depth-averaged models are available and implemented in commercial software almost no continuum models exist, that would allow the extraction of forces acting on buildings and protection structures. Moreover, no two-phase material models exist that allow the simulation of the complete process of initiation, propagation and stopping of a flow. This work attempts to fill in an important part of this gap. First, the basic components of the model are developed for free-surface flow of a single phase fluid. On this formulation we investigate a meshless method, and come to the conclusion that the main advantages of the meshless method can be obtained by using simple finite elements in conjunction with a re-meshing strategy. We show that the method retains optimal order of convergence. The two-phase model proposed subsequently formulates the equations of the flow of a two-phase mixture in a moving reference frame. The problem of updating the positions of the nodes of two phases is solved by re-creating a new mesh after each update. The nodal variables are mapped onto this new mesh by linear interpolation. The computation of volume fractions of the two phases is de-coupled from the computation of the main nodal variables, the phase velocities and the pressure. The volume fractions are computed by evaluating the change of local density of nodal masses of the phases. On a series of test problems we demonstrate the performance of the two-phase formulation. We show in particular that sedimentation of a solid phase within a mixture can be simulated and the results can be verified with an analytical solution. Finally, the impact of a mudflow on an obstacle is simulated and a time history of the force acting on the obstacle is extracted. The test problems illustrate the versatility of the method for simulating a wide variety of problems of two-phase flow.</p></div><ul class="record-metadata"><p></p><p class="infoscience_links"><a class="infoscience_link_detailed" href="https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/128631?ln=en" target="_blank">Detailed record</a>
